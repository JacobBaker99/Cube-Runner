# Cube-Runner
 Cube Runner Game Created in Unity

Cube Runner is inspired by a nostalgic game I played as a kid whenever I needed a calming escape. The player rolls or slides down a slope, skillfully avoiding obstacles along the way. While some versions of the game run indefinitely, aiming for the best score, I've implemented a set number of rounds in this version. However, adding an infinite mode with dynamic obstacles would be a straightforward enhancement. Thanks to the gravity implementation, the game naturally becomes more challenging as speed increases.
